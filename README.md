# Algo-snake

## Project Summary

Algo-snake is a small game written in vanilla javascript where you play as classic snake and race against a search algorithm.  The game implements a graph-based data structure and a breadth first search algorithm. The aim of the game is to play as classic snake and race against Algo-snake to get to the food first.

Use arrow keys to control the direction of classic snake. Avoid the walls and don't crash into yourself.
