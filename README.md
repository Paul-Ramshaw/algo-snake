# Algo-snake

## Project Summary

Algo-snake is a small game built in vanilla javascript implementing a graph-based data structure and a breadth first search algorithm. The aim of the game is to play as classic snake and race against Algo-snake to get to the food first.

Use arrow keys to control the direction of classic snake. Avoid the walls and don't crash into yourself.

You can play the game here: [https://paul-ramshaw.github.io/](https://paul-ramshaw.github.io/)
